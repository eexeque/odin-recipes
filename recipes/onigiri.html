Not to mention how AMERICAN they are!  And kid friendly!  So everyone, make jelly filled donuts for your hiking trip which involves battling little critters and half-brained villains today!</p>

    <h3>Steps | Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar with 1 cup of warm water in a measuring cup. Let stand for 5 minutes or until the mixture is frothy and smells yeasty.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flours, remaining sugar, salt, baking powder and nutmeg in a large bowl. Grease separate bowl with oil.</li>
        <li>Stir yeast mixture into flour mixture with a wooden spoon until sticky dough forms. Add up to ¼ cup warm water to make smooth dough.</li>
        <li>Stir in the melted margarine.</li>
        <li>Dough is very soft and sticky at this stage. Turn it onto a well floured surface and knead for 6-8 minutes using extra flour as kneaded, until the dough is soft, smooth and pliable.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap or towel and let rise in a warm place for 1 ½ hours.</li>
        <li>Flour a baking sheet. Roll the dough into ¼" thick round on a well-floured surface. Cut into circles using 2" round cutter and place them on the floured baking sheet.  Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil until hot but not smoking. Fry donuts in oil for 3-5 minutes, or until deep golden brown on all sides, flipping 2-3 times. Drain on paper-towel lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Roll the donuts while still warm in superfine sugar. Cool.</li>
        <li>Poke small hole in side of each donut with a toothpick or a skewer. Using a pastry bag fitted with small round tip, fill each donut with 1 tsp of jam/jelly.</li>
    </ol>
